## Angular History

*   AngularJS developed by Miško Hevery and announced in 2009 

*   Later AngularJS became popular framework for building web applications

*   The AngularJS project was brought into Google, and version 1.0 was officially launched in October 2010

*   Angular VS AngularJS

    *   **Any release from 1.0 through 2.0 is known as AngularJS**
    
    *   **For versions 2.0 and greater, it’s known as just Angular.** 
        Version 2.0 was a complete rewrite, and all versions after it are planned as incremental changes upon it.

## Angular Basics

*   Angular is a **platform and framework** for building single page applications using HTML and TypeScript.

*   Angular can run on different platforms apart from web, such as Desktop and Mobile

*   Angular applications are written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that provides syntactic sugar 
    such as strong typing and object-oriented techniques.

*   Angular core functionality and optional functionality available as Typescript libraries. 
    Angular applications import these typescript libraries to use
    
*   Angular applications are created and developed using a command-line tool made by the Angular team called the Angular CLI. 
    It automates many development tasks, such as scaffolding, testing, and deploying an Angular application, 
    which would take a lot of time to configure manually.

*   **The popularity of the Angular framework is considerably reflected in its broad support of tooling**    

*   **The architecture of an Angular application is based on a hierarchical representation of components**

*   **Components are the fundamental building blocks of an Angular application.** They represent and control a particular portion of a web page called the view

*   Some examples of components are as follows:

    *   A list of customers
    *   A list of claims
 
*   Components of an Angular application can be logically organized as a tree:

*   An Angular application typically has one main component, called AppComponent, by convention. 

*   Each component in the tree can communicate and interact with its siblings using an application programming interface defined by each one.
